This plugin implements Italian syllabification according to the syllable
description and the syllabification rules described in

 Pietro Maturi, "I suoni delle lingue, i suoni dell'italiano",

using an algorithm proposed by Giulio Paci.

The algorithm has been designed to:
 - simplify the syllabification problem;
 - minimize the exceptions (and avoiding the requirement of a database
   of valid phones combination).

The syllabification problem is described as the problem of finding the
first phone of each syllable. As each syllable is allowed to contain
at most one vowel, the first phone of each syllable is thus searched
between two vowels.  Given a phones' sequence, the first phone is
automatically identified as the first phone of the first syllable, and
all the subsequent phones up to the first vowel are associated to the
first syllable. Then the algorithm proceeds iteratively for each vowel
in the sequence, by first looking at the position of the next vowel
and then moving backward until the phone sonority level do not
decrease. The decision to move backward, starting from the next vowel,
instead of moving forward, starting from the current one allows the
algorithm to implicitly respect both the "sonority level decrease" and
the "maximum incipit" principles, by explicitly implementing only the
first one.
In order to minimize syllabification rules exceptions (mainly due to
how sibilants behave in Italian), the sonority level of sibilants is
higher than expected and the overall sonority scale is thus defined
as:

 occlusives < fricatives < nasals < laterals < sibilants < vibrants <
approximants < vowels.

Thanks to this scale the only required exceptions are that the following
sequences belong to the same syllable:

 - chains of approximants
 - nasal + occlusive 
 - sibilant + nasal
 - sibilant + lateral
 - lateral + nasal

The algorithm has been successfully applied on several hundred of
thousands preannotated sequences and it was able to perform reasonable
syllabification even on non-standard phones sequences (e.g., foreign
words).
